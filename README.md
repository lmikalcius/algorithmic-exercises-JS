# algorithmic-work-JS

This is mostly for my own reference, but please feel free to judge my capabilities and even comment on what I could have done better. Most of these are toy problems that I worked on to review JS and some algorithms (although some of them I did when I was first learning to code and the problems didn't feel too playful haha).

Almost all of this code was written by me. Some of it may have come from Eloquent JavaScript, while at DBC (in Ruby originally), or with some help from the wonderful (and sometimes not so polite) people of StackOverflow (although you'll see in most cases I have taken a different approach or structured it differently).
